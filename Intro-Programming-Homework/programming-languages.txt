C#  is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative,
	 declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. 
	It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and 
	ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

C++  is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, 
	while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.It is designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded
	 resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed 
	to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),
	 meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

JavaScript  is a high level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript
	 language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production.

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, 
	and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++, or Java.
	The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

C++, Java and Python are similar to C# with that they are object-oriented languages,JavaScript uses Prototype-based programming that is a style of OOP.
